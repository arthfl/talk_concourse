% Concourse - Make CI/CD suck less

# whoami
* Florian Arthofer
* Cloud engineering @ Dynatrace
* @arthfl pretty much everywhere

# What is it?
* "An open-source continuous thing-doer"
* Yet another CI/CD pipeline?
* Fully container-based
* immutable as fuck

# Why is it nice?
* Everything is a container
* Configuration is just simple YAML
* Config *must* be commited in some repo to be used
* No way to configure things in the web-UI (yes, this is good)
* Easily extendable

# How does it work?

# Pipelines

# Jobs

# Tasks

# Resources

# Architecture

# How do i use it?

# How do i deploy it?
* For local development and testing: docker-compose
* The easiest option for production: Use the BOSH release
